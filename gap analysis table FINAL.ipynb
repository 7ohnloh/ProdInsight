SETUP**\n","- **Imports** required libraries like `pandas`, `openai`, `nltk`, `textblob`, etc.\n","- Downloads NLTK resources needed for tokenization and POS tagging.\n","- Reads your OpenAI API key securely from Drive.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **STEP 1: CONFIG**\n","- Defines the **list of cleaned CSV files** from Reddit and YouTube.\n","- Maps each file to its **corresponding product** (`AirPods Max`, `Sony XM5`, or `Momentum 4`).\n","- Defines a **set of valid specs/features** to focus on (e.g., battery, weight, price).\n","- Builds a **noise filter** that removes common stopwords and irrelevant slang or brand words from the keyword extraction step.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **STEP 2: LOAD + PROCESS FILES**\n","- Iterates through each cleaned CSV file.\n","- For each comment:\n","  - Performs **sentiment analysis** using TextBlob (`Positive`, `Neutral`, `Negative`).\n","  - Performs **keyword extraction**, keeping only nouns that match valid specs and are not in the noise list.\n","- Results are stored in a single unified dataframe `df_results`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **STEP 3: GAP ANALYSIS**\n","- Explodes keywords so each row has one keyword per comment.\n","- Filters to retain only keywords that are valid specs.\n","- **Groups sentiment scores** by `product` and `feature`.\n","- Creates a **pivot table** showing average sentiment score per spec per product.\n","- Computes:\n","  - **Competitor Average** = average of Sony XM5 and Momentum 4 scores\n","  - **Gap_vs_Competitors** = how much worse AirPods Max performs relative to the competition\n","  - **Underperforming = True** if gap exceeds 0.2\n","- Adds **price-to-performance (P2P)** scores by dividing sentiment by product price.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **STEP 4: GPT DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES**\n","- Picks **top N underperforming specs** based on the highest `Gap_vs_Competitors`.\n","- For each one, collects up to 10 real comments mentioning that spec.\n","- Feeds those into GPT-3.5-turbo via OpenAI API with a detailed prompt asking for:\n","  - User problems\n","  - Measurable design issues\n","  - Suggestions\n","  - ROI implications\n","- GPT response is printed as a **feature-specific design insight block**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 📊 Explanation for Use in Project Report\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Objective:**\n","To identify actionable design opportunities for the AirPods Max by analyzing real user feedback from Reddit and YouTube and benchmarking it against top competitors (Sony XM5, Sennheiser Momentum 4).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Why This Analysis Matters:**\n","\n","1. **Grounds design decisions in user sentiment:**\n","   - Instead of relying on intuition or vague reviews, we quantify how users feel about specific product features (e.g., weight, comfort, battery life).\n","   - This allows product teams to prioritize real pain points.\n","\n","2. **Benchmarks against market leaders:**\n","   - By comparing AirPods Max to Sony and Sennheiser, we identify where the product **underperforms in the eyes of users**, even though it has a higher price point.\n","\n","3. **Pinpoints features with measurable gaps:**\n","   - The “Gap_vs_Competitors” metric directly highlights features where sentiment is significantly more negative for AirPods Max than its competitors.\n","\n","4. **Justifies ROI-driven redesigns:**\n","   - Using GPT, we translate complaints into **design requirements** (e.g., “uncomfortable” → adjust headband pressure).\n","   - Each suggestion is accompanied by potential **business impact** (e.g., retention, revenue, or brand perception).\n","\n","5. **Makes funding decisions easier:**\n","   - If a design flaw (e.g., “heavy build”) appears across hundreds of comments and GPT suggests a fix, the PM can argue:\n","     > “Spending $2k on redesigning this component could lead to a significant boost in user satisfaction and market competitiveness.”\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **How This Helps a Product Manager:**\n","| Value Added | Description |\n","|-------------|-------------|\n","| **Prioritization** | Focus on specs that matter most to users and where the product underdelivers. |\n","| **Cost-benefit clarity** | Identify fixes that bring high sentiment improvement with minimal cost (via P2P and GPT analysis). |\n","| **Evidence-based justification** | Provides hard data and real quotes to justify design and engineering changes. |\n","| **Strategic alignment** | Aligns product roadmap with competitive intelligence and user expectations. |\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🔚 Final Note\n","This analysis transforms scattered social media feedback into **actionable intelligence** for product, design, and business teams — making it easier to decide **where to invest, what to fix, and how to win back market edge**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"U_6sN3VFBT-u"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# ---------------------------------------------\n","# SETUP\n","#
